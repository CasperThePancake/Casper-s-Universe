    <h2>Thoughts of atoms or not</h2>

    <p>We all think... a whole lot. You're reading this post right now, and you're probably thinking something along the lines of "what the heck is this going to be about?", which is an understandable question. In this post, I want to think about what thoughts actually are. Just like feelings and dreams, how exactly do we <i>feel</i> them?</p>
    <h3>A thought activation</h3>
    <p>Well, we can start at the beginning. Let's say there's an apple on the table in front of you, which causes you to think of an apple. And when I say 'think of an apple', I mean you can describe it in your head, smell it, taste it without actually taking a bite. The main steps in between seeing and thinking are self-explanatory. You see the apple using your two eyes. Those two eyes convert the image into a big array of electrical impulses that get sent through your nervous system to your brain. There, your brain receives the input and interprets it to activate other parts of the brain, like the part that can describe the apple, the part that can imagine the smell and taste, etc.<br><br>But that's the rub! How does an electrical signal in your brain get converted to a thought or a feeling? This problem in philosophy is called "The Hard Problem of Consciousness".<br><br>When you are happy, this is because your brain receives certain signals to release dopamine. Dopamine causes happiness, but how does it do that? When you want to pick up a carton of milk, we can easily explain it like in this example:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>You see a carton of milk</li>
        <li>Your eyes (cones and such) turn this into an electrical signal</li>
        <li>In your brain, this signal is interpreted and recognized as a carton of milk</li>
        <li>Your brain sends an electrical signal to your arm muscles</li>
        <li>Your arms stretch out to pick up the carton of milk</li>
    </ul>
    <p>But such a step-by-step guide to feeling things end abruptly when we get to how a neurotransmitter like dopamine can actually cause 'you' to feel the way you do. It is an unanswered riddle, and there are two competing sides in finding the answer.</p>
    <h3>Dualism</h3>
    <p>Dualism is the theory that states this strange riddle must lead us to believe there is something more outside of just the human body. The human body is what we know the workings of today: it houses your muscles, your bones, your brain, everything that makes you live. But the actual experience of being able to feel something, the actual thing that inhabits this body, is something completely different. Some may call it your soul, but there's probably many names. So the body and the soul are two separate things, and the soul inhabits the body. A body can survive without a soul, but then it'd be more like a robot. A robot can do the things we do, like walking and speaking, but it does not have feelings.<br><br>This might sound very weird, but stay with me. Maybe I'm the only one, but sometimes when I'm walking around, this same thought randomly pops into my head. I'm walking here, but how am I actually experiencing this? Who is this 'I' that is seeing through the eyes in my body and using its muscles? Does my brain actively know what love is, or is it a non-physical mind inside of the body that does the feeling? The thoughts I have in this situation are far-fetched debates about my consciousness. I have become aware of the fact that 'I' exist. I'm not just a mindless robot without a choice, me being aware of my own existence means there must be something inside of me.<br><br>Neuroscientists keep discovering new things about the brain. They know perfectly well that happiness is caused by a dopamine release, and that fear is caused when the amygdala is activated, but they are unable to bridge the gap between physical processes and subjective feelings. Neuroscience can also prove that when certain brain regions are absent, we don't feel certain emotions anymore, which does mean the brain activates something to cause a feeling, but we don't know what.<br><br>Believing in dualism of course brings its own new questions, some of which are listed here.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>How is the brain connected to the mind?</li>
        <li>What happens to the mind when the body dies?
            <ul>
                <li>Does the mind also die?</li>
                <li>Does the mind wander off alone? Forever?</li>
                <li>Does the mind get scrubbed clean and re-used in a new body?</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Can a mind become weaker to cause things like dementia? Or is this all related to the brain?</li>
        <li>What is a mind made of?
            <ul>
                <li>Does it actually involve belief in the existence of spiritual, non-physical things?</li>
                <li>Is it made of an undiscovered matter?</li>
                <li>Does the mind have inner workings and sections like the brain? Or is it one big "unsplittable" thing?</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><s>Does the mind know I have a crush on a girl from school?</s></li>
    </ul>
    <p>To get into some more scientific details here, those subjective experiences we're trying to figure out are called 'qualia'. Examples of qualia include the taste of a drink, the color red, your love for someone, pain, etc.</p>
    <h3>Materialism</h3>
    <p>Materialism is the opposite theory, proposing that anything we do and feel can be explained through physical processes only. Everything can be explained using the movement of atoms alone. While this certainly makes things more organized and simple than adding in a mind, it raises some very important questions. First off it doesn't solve our mystery! Even if you argue that those qualia are also felt through physical processes, you can't explain (yet) what physical processes those are. Second, if everything is controlled by atoms, it would mean that literally everything in the universe is predetermined. Your feelings, your test scores, your first kiss, your every movement, all of them are already determined. If you were to take a snapshot of the position and other properties of every particle in the universe, and get a super-computer to run (physics) simulations on them, you'd be able to predict anything in the future.<br><br>That last thought is both interesting and worrying. It's interesting because it opens the door to more human control over, well, the universe. That and cooler machines for us to play with. But it's worrying, because believing in materialism and the fact that everything is controlled by particles, instantly denies the existence of a free will.<br><br>Or does it? Many argue that if particles control what you do and how you feel - and if you can just predict anything anywhere at any time - you're not actually in control of your life. But others do argue that the decisions you make - even if the particles make you make them - are what we call your free will. They are still free will, because you're making them. It doesn't matter if a particle millions of lightyears away makes you pick up an apple, you still decided to do it.<br><br>But not a lot of people are convinced by this, which is another reason for them to believe in dualism and the mind. The mind, together with the ability to feel those qualia, is the part of you that actually makes the decisions. It gets input from your brain to feel things, and sends back output to make it do things.</p>
    <h3>Other theories</h3>
    <p>Finally, I'd like to touch on two other theories people have come up with to give an answer to this mystery.<br><br>Emergentism is a theory that calls the feeling of consciousness an emergent property of the brain. If we look at one water molecule, we cannot call it 'wet', but if we put billions together to form actual water, we <b>can</b> call that 'wet'. So a complex group can create emergent properties. Following this logic, emergentists argue that consciousness is an emergent property of the brain's complexity.<br><br>The integrated information theory or IIT is a bit more complex. When your brain processes information, it gets that information from different places or inputs. It can get information from the eyes, the ears, the tongue, the skin, etc. and process that information altogether. The brain does not process all of these separately, it combines multiple inputs to form a single image of a situation. We can say that the processing of information is interconnected or integrated. And according to IIT, this integration is what causes consciousness to arise. The combination of sight, sound, taste, etc. creates a unified experience, which leads you to feel what you feel when you experience certain things. IIT goes further by explaining that there are different levels of integration, linked to different levels of consciousness. This level is called Phi (Œ¶). This allows them to directly explain why you are more conscious (high Œ¶) than a bird (lower Œ¶) or even a chair (near-zero Œ¶).</p>
    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>If this post seemed a bit odd to you, you're not mistaken. I've introduced you to a key mystery in philosophy and science, one that remains unsolved and will most likely never be solved - because of its complex nature. Or perhaps it will be solved, and one theory will be crowned the truth. But until then, don't get <i>too</i> lost thinking about why we think. Just be happy that we have this gift.</p>
