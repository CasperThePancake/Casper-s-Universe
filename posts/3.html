    <h2>Belief vs institution</h2>
    <h3 id="postDate">September 17th, 2024</h3>
    <h3 id="wordCount" class="postLength" title="Estimated time to read">COUNT</h3>
    <p>In a previous post on this site, I talked about beliefs. If clicking twice and reading a post is too much for you, this quote says it all:</p>
    <blockquote>It is not the belief that matters, but whether it makes you live a good life. It doesn't matter if someone believes that rocks hold magical powers or that cows fart rainbows, as long as they're good people we should all just be happy.</blockquote>
    <p>You can view this post as a sequel to that one, with new ideas, but also one main focus.</p>
    <h3>Institutions</h3>
    <p>The main focus is the difference between a belief and its institution. I like using words without checking if they're meant to be used that way, but what I mean by an institution is the following. An institution is a central body surrounding or the face of, a belief. Examples may include the following:</p>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Belief</th>
            <th>Institution</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Political ideology</td>
            <td>Political party</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Protecting nature</td>
            <td>Greenpeace</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Higher education</td>
            <td>Universities (Oxford, Harvard, ...)</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    <p>The two we'll be focusing on today are much more broad and divided.</p>
    <h3>The church</h3>
    <p>The first is the catholic church, or just the church. It represents the Christian belief. This belief is focused around the existence of God, his son Jesus Christ as a messiah to the world, and in general every tale the Bible talks about. I should make it very clear that even in belief, different levels exist. Some people believe every word in the Bible, some believe little to nothing, and most are somewhere in between.<br><br>The belief always precedes the institution, which in this case means that Christian belief existed way before the church as an institution existed. The exact time at which the church was founded is debatable, since it was over 2000 years ago and there are multiple definitions of 'founded'. Some say it was founded right after Jesus' death and resurrection, some say it was founded later when the church claimed its first actual power - through land or political influence. The first pope was literally an apostle of Jesus Christ, so we'll take that for an answer.</p>
    <h3>Power rises</h3>
    <p>As time and history went on, the catholic church gained more and more power in the world. In recent years, the amount of people who identify as catholic believers has decreased. But in the past, it was normal for the catholic belief to grow in numbers each year.<br><br>Not that many people question the difference between a belief and an institution. However, it is important to remember that being a catholic does not mean you are connected to the catholic church in any way. If you choose to believe in catholicism, it is a whole other choice to follow the catholic institution that is the church. The church merely represents the belief. Sadly, many forget this and they seem to assume that the church <b>is</b> the belief. And while this is not true, the church does <b>control</b> the belief, whether we want it or not. Nearly every stream of information about catholicism, from churches, to printed bibles, to readings, to ceremonies, to online information, is influenced in some way by the church.<br><br>A singular body that may, to some, resemble a government, being the face of something many people deeply believe in, is without any doubt dangerous. If the church wants to accomplish anything, they're guaranteed to have the ability to accomplish it, thanks to the power of the people who follow them.<br><br>The starting goal of the catholic church was of course to spread the catholic belief to as many people as possible, following the vision that it was the right way to see the world and that it would help us all out. While this was a nice goal, the immense popularity that came with it, pushed the catholic church to strive farther and farther from them.<br><br>If you think about it, the way to convince someone of a belief should always be with words and stories. You tell someone about your belief, what it envelops, the stories that support it, and that can convince them to believe in it as well. But not everyone can be convinced by words alone, something the catholic church realized rather early on. Don't fool yourself: we love following popular and big things, it's simply human nature. So when the church was big enough, they were able to start doing bigger things to attract more people to catholicism. This included constructing churches and cathedrals, funding catholic painting and music, selling copies of the Bible, and traveling further around the world. And we all know it worked, because more than a billion people today are catholics.<br><br>But this is where things started going south. The original goal of spreading a positively-oriented belief, quickly transformed into a hunt of power and influence over the world. This caused the church to do unspeakable things, which couldn't be further removed from the values and principles they were meant to represent.</p>
    <h3>Catholic abuse</h3>
    <p>The following is a concise list of ways the catholic church abused its power throughout the years.<br><br>First is the selling of indulgences. During the Middle Ages, the catholic church started massively selling indulgences, which to put it shortly were tickets to heaven. In their own words, it was a small fee that'd help you reduce punishment for sins in the afterlife. In this example, the church is abusing the concepts that the Bible introduced - sins, heaven, afterlife - and proclaiming they can have control over them through the sale of indulgences. Today, hardly anybody would fall for this. But back in the day, it delivered the church an unfathomable amount of cash.<br><br>Second is the silencing of critique. This one item on the list includes many topics. When the church was at its peak, they feared anyone that critiqued them, going as far as to do anything in their power to eliminate them. The church played a massive role in the Spanish Inquisition, where dissenters - people denying the Christian belief - were punished, tortured, and robbed of their property. The church persecuted many scientists for their so-called "anti-christian" messages and discoveries. A famous example is Galileo, who argued that the Earth revolved around the Sun, which is the opposite of what the Bible proclaims. During the Reformation Era, when certain parties were starting to distance themselves from the institution, the church tried everything they could to eliminate dissenters. This included many Protestant reformers, like Martin Luther. They engaged in bloody conflicts and wars all across Europe.<br><br>Third is the existence of crusades and religious wars. Multiple beliefs have for centuries fought for control over the Holy Land - a region near Jerusalem and Palestine. While the catholic church has dropped out of this war in recent centuries, they did some awful stuff back in the day, just for a piece of land that played significance in their belief.<br><br>Fourth is the abuse of catholic church workers, most of which children. Including children in the catholic church and its public ceremonies is a good thing, but many popes and priests - who were not allowed to marry or have sex with anyone - abused this through rampages of pedophilia and rape. Even today new stories are still coming out.<br><br>Fifth is the radical political influence of the church back in the day. The church wanted control, which included land and political power. The Holy Roman Empire existed back in the day, and Vatican City is still an officially recognized governing body. To combat other parties, the church often used the process of excommunication. This meant they - as the so-called judges of God - could decide whether anyone was worthy of the catholic belief. They proclaimed that they could ban anyone from the religious sacraments and community of the church.<br><br>Sixth is the fact that the church was and probably is filled with inequality. People at the top are wealthy, while those at the bottom are not. One could also argue that the entire existence of a pyramid structure like this is morally unjust, but sadly there's no other way to maintain a body as large as the church.<br><br>Finally, there's many examples of the church using slave labor. This included the construction of their many religious buildings, which also needed materials that had to be collected.<br><br>All in all, the abuse of the church came down to a negative evolution. The church started out by spreading a belief, but evolved into controlling the belief. They proclaimed they were the "chosen institution", they had control over who went to heaven, who had rights to participate in sacraments, who was forgiven, and who was not. For an institution representing belief in God, it seems they tried to go a little too close to that name.</p>
    <h3>The church today</h3>
    <p>Today, the church has acknowledged many of these past mistakes. Newer popes are much more progressive and while the church always lags behind on trends a bit, at least they aren't abusing their power as much as in the past. I'm not saying that what they did can be instantly forgiven. It cannot, but we also can't get stuck in the past; even institutions do change and learn from their mistakes. I'm also not saying that every example of power abuse is absent from the church today. The stories of excommunication, wars, and indulgences are indeed behind them. But stories of pedophilia, demanding money from followers, protecting clergy involved in scandals, censoring progressive ideas, banning women from catholic church roles, etc. are still widespread. They also don't seem to be going anywhere soon.</p>
    <h3>The second belief</h3>
    <p>The other institution I'd like to talk about is that of science. Not any specific science, but just science.<br><br>As the Middle Ages passed and scientific research started becoming actually useful, we discovered much more about how the world works than we'd ever have imagined.<br><br>Both the catholic belief and science portray ways to accept and understand the world. If someone heals from a deadly disease, you could argue that the cells in their body and medical treatment saved them, but you could also argue that God saved them. Both views of the situation are - in my honest opinion - neither true or false. The reason I add 'in my honest opinion' there, is because I'm certain that 99% of people would call one explanation the truth and the other "simply a spiritual belief". And yes, I myself do not believe in anything catholic, and I believe that a healed person can thank medical nature, but what I or the majority of people believe is not necessarily the one truth.<br><br>In the Middle Ages, nearly everyone was a Christian. I mentioned before that scientists like Galileo, supporting opposite ideas, were persecuted as "liars". Back in those days, being a Christian was the norm and being a scientist was seen as a rarity and to most as a strange belief. While it is not one to one, we can draw a direct comparison to the situation today. The roles have simply been switched around. Now, believing in science is the norm and being a full Christian is seen as a rarity and to some as a strange belief.</p>
    <h3>Side-tracking: is it really christianity OR science?</h3>
    <p>I'd like to shortly touch on this question. This post might make it seem like you cannot believe in science and Christianity at the same time. It might feel like I'm arguing this, but that's simply because I'm pitting the two against each other for the sake of this post. In actuality, it is completely possible and common to believe in both. You can believe more in one and a little less in the other as well. The way you combine beliefs - not only these two - is up to you. Some people believe that science itself is a creation of God, which makes both easy to believe. Some people believe that scientific research is the search for God himself. Everything here is up to you and subjective, as long as you're living a good life.</p>
    <h3>Side-tracking: why did science become "more popular"?</h3>
    <p>Why did science start convincing more people of it and less people of christianity? We can attribute this to many factors. First is the nature of the belief. The nature of science is proving theories through calculation and experimentation. A theory is proven true when it can correctly predict a situation. People believe in gravity as a part of science, because it can accurately predict how an object falls to the ground. But believing in Christianity is harder. It requires the ability to believe in something without being able to prove it - yes I know that scientific experiments being correct is also not hard truth, but at some point we have to draw the line. The ability to believe in a divine power to clarify daily occurrences is easier said than done. Back in the day we didn't have the science we have today, so it was just the norm to believe, but to still believe in Christianity today, with all the existing science, is a feat to accomplish. If I'm making it sound like still believing in Christianity today is idiotic, I am not. When I say it is "harder" and "a feat to accomplish", I literally mean that it requires more courage, strength and willpower. As I said before, I could not care less about what you believe in - as in care about what it means about you, I am always interested - all that matters is if you're a good person.</p>
    <h3>The second belief</h3>
    <p>Naming one institution for the scientific belief is impossible, it's not as simple as naming the church for Christianity. There's thousands of scientific companies, sectors, government agencies, etc. who represent science through education, experimentation, and spreading the scientific knowledge we possess today. When I talk about "the scientific institution", I am referring to all of these at once.<br><br>When I discussed the Catholic belief, I mentioned that a Christian belief almost always leads people to the following of the church. The same goes here. If you believe in science, you will most likely put your trust in the scientific institution. You trust them to do good with the knowledge and power they have. Yes, power, because just like the church has it, the scientific institution has an unfathomable amount of it too.<br><br>And this is where the core of my goal with this post comes in. When the church did things wrong in the Middle Ages, nobody said anything. The reason? People didn't know any better and they had nothing "better" to believe in. Nowadays, the church cannot get away with nearly as many things as they did back then. The church is still under constant critique for their past actions and their mistakes in the present. Many people (sadly) use this as an argument to downthrow the Christian belief itself. They draw a straight line from "the church abuses its power" to "catholicism is bad and evil". They forget that a belief and its institution are separate. They believe that when an institution does something wrong, they can blame the belief.<br><br>But this is completely false, and a widespread notion that <b>must</b> be eradicated as soon as possible. Too often do we hear stories of people being shamed for believing in what they believe, because the institution that represents that belief does a shameful thing. Going from "the church used slaves to build cathedrals" to "the christian belief is evil" is already stupid, but going from "the church used slaves to build cathedrals" to "my catholic friend is a moron" makes me question who the moron here really is. I highly respect people who are Christian, even though I don't believe an inch of what they believe in, simply because I respect anyone who is a good person. And being Christian does not decide if you are one.</p>
    <h3>Holy science</h3>
    <p>People pit science and catholicism against each other all the time. Everyone sees them as complete opposites. They constantly oppose each other, they constantly disprove what the other proclaims.<br><br>But what if I tell you that they're not that much different? In fact, what if I tell you that at their core, they're exactly the same thing?<br><br>Okay, calling them "exactly the same thing" may be a far stretch, but at their core it isn't. Here's just a list of what they have in common.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>They are both beliefs</li>
        <li>They are both incredibly popular</li>
        <li>They both try to explain the world around us</li>
        <li>They both have institutions that guide their followers</li>
        <li>Both have influenced history, culture, and society</li>
        <li>Both rely on established texts and writings</li>
        <li>Both have traditions of formal education</li>
        <li>Both are subject to internal and external disagreements</li>
        <li>Both are constantly evolving to adapt with time and new discoveries</li>
        <li>Both are seen as opposites by many, but seen as possible to co-exist by others</li>
    </ul>
    <p>But the thing I hear the most - and the reason why I'm writing this post - is that science has become more popular than christianity, because it does not come with the abuse, hatred, and exploitation that the church has been dragging on for centuries. It is with great sorrow that I have to inform you that this is complete bullshit.<br><br>While science is generally seen as a pursuit of truth, it is not at all immune to abuse of power. The only reason why people don't bring it up as often, or don't seem to link it to the church's abuse, is because of its different and more scattered nature. The church is one body abusing loads, while in science it's loads of institution abusing some. The scientific institution also doesn't sell indulgences or build cathedrals, their forms of abuse are completely different. Here we go again.<br><br>First is the abuse in the pharmaceutical industry. Science gave us knowledge, and now these institutions are arguing they can take control and gate-keep that knowledge behind massive paywalls. Not only the knowledge is being monetized, the worst part is the artificial inflation of drug prices. I'm not here to revolt and ask that every medicine becomes free, but drug prices should be fair and equal for everyone. Since many people do not understand what goes into making them, pharmaceutical companies can jack up the prices for their products to insane heights all they want.<br><br>Speaking of people not understanding science, this can be abused in a second way. A whole lot of people believe in science, while they don't understand half of it. That on its own is not a problem, because it's completely normal. But it can be abused to death! It makes it much easier to lie, convince people of false data, and much more.<br><br>Third is how science can be used as a weapon. Science started as another way to understand the world, but when people realized that its knowledge could be used to destroy others, horrific things started happening. A large portion of scientific research today is tied to the military and the development of methods to destroy things.<br><br>Fourth are the unethical practices within science and its research. I think we all know that scientific research and experimentation on animals big and small is a thing. I understand that it is necessary to test things and I do not support a ban on it, but there is simply too much killing and there must be more regulation.<br><br>The fifth example of abuse is tied to the tech industry. And yes, this is science, because what else is it?! We use technology every single day, and as time goes on these companies are becoming more and more involved in our daily lives. We all know data is stolen all the time, not only through hacks, but also just by the companies themselves. Aren't we trusting these institutions too much?<br><br>Corruption is the sixth example. The scientific institution is often very easily bribeable, because they need money to do the science itself. A clear example of this is when big oil companies bribe scientific institutions to lie about or hide their impact on climate change. The scientific search for truth doesn't seem that clean after all.<br><br>To end it off, I'll put every other example I could think of in a list, because there's way more to talk about and I think these examples suffice.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Bribery and corruption in academic and research institutions</li>
        <li>Low-quality and rushed scientific work due to pressure</li>
        <li>Plagiarism, fabrication, and the replication crisis</li>
        <li>Eugenics movement and racial science</li>
        <li>The questionable ethics of GMOs and pesticides</li>
        <li>The lobbying of politics</li>
        <li>Spam and phishing through fake scientific sources</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>To conclude, I think I've made my point very clear. Right now, the majority of people are still bullying the church for its abuse of the Christian belief, while they are praising the scientific institution for its clean quest for truth. But the real truth is that the scientific institution is not any better than the church. It's just very different and harder to connect to the source.<br><br>If any of this feels overwhelming to you, don't worry. If you believe in Christianity or science, don't worry. Go out there and believe whatever you want to believe, just be a good person, and don't let people abuse that belief to make you believe bad things. And remember: the belief is not the institution.</p>
