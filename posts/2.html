    <h2>Beliefs</h2>

    <p>Everyone has their own beliefs. Like many things in life, beliefs are subjective things. They're much like opinions, because what you believe in is always different from someone else. Even if two people believe the earth orbits the sun, they may disagree on certain nuances - or they may disagree on completely different beliefs.</p>
    <h3>Religion</h3>
    <p>Religion is a type of belief. If someone believes, it doesn't immediately mean they are religious. But if someone is religious, it does mean they believe. More specifically, they believe in whatever that religion entails. If you're a religious Christian - you could be a Christian who isn't religious - you believe in God. It is of course wrong of me to generalize the Christian belief into 'believing in God', as it is much more than that and there are different tiers, but that's the basis. Besides this example there of course exist hundreds or even thousands of other religions. </p>
    <h3>Science</h3>
    <p>Yes, even science is in some way a belief. If you are a scientist, the chances are relatively high that you believe in what science proves. From the existence of gigantic, massive black holes to the inner workings of genetic reduplication, we've come a long way.<br><br>Those who believe in science also exist in tiers. These days it is hard to disagree with what science proves, mostly because what has been proven clearly works as it has advanced humanity for decades. Those who do neglect science in search of their own truth - e.g. flat-earthers - are often seen as complete idiots and conspiracy theorists. So some people just believe in science, meaning they accept that it's correct. But it can of course go farther: many believe that science can save the world, akin to how deeply religious christians may believe Jesus saved the world. When we start going into extremes, we of course get the people who only accept their belief as truth, denying the existence of subjectivity - but more on that later.</p>
    <h3>Side-tracking: the reality of science</h3>
    <p>At the end of the day, what we do in science is all made up. Every law, every unit, every name we give to every animal and bug and organ, it's all a creation of the human mind. The names might be made up, but it is acceptable to argue that the concepts themselves are not fictional. Gravity is a human-made idea, but it is the concept that describes something that does actually exist in the universe, in reality. Nobody can deny gravity, but the universe does not know what 'gravity' is. It knows that two objects attract each other - even though 'objects' and 'attract' are also human inventions - and that's enough for us to give it a name. Your body doesn't know what DNA is, it just so happens that chemical reactions lead to its existence, which we can describe in biology. But reality also doesn't know what chemical reactions are, they just sort of happen. They've always been there. But why? Why do things work the way they do? <br><br>Sure, positives and negatives attract. Sure, two masses exert forces on each other. Sure, light is a wave. But why? We can't refer to something like the Big Bang for this, because the Big Bang itself requires those three axioms to even physically exist. So why do they exist? Nobody knows and we will most likely never know. For some it is this uncertainty that leads them to believe in a higher power, for some a further explanation is not required because they accept how it is. </p>
    <h3>The right belief</h3>
    <p>Perhaps that is exactly why beliefs are so interesting and why we should never discredit anyone for believing what they believe. If someone believes in god, maybe it is simply because there are too many questions science can't answer, and religion can. Whether it's right or not - everyone has their opinions, if it's a way for them to understand reality better and live in it more comfortably, why should we care? If they're happy and they live a good life, where's our permission to tell them what to believe in?<br><br>And that's exactly what divides good belief from bad belief. Because there is such a thing as a bad belief. If your belief leads you to do bad things, it's not a particularly good belief. You could once again argue that the definition of a bad thing is subjective. But you could also keep pushing that argument and eventually shit on everyone, arguing you can do whatever you want because everything is technically correct. And that's obviously not the way to go, so some things just aren't okay.<br><br>Beliefs are what we make of them, but their end goal should always be to help us understand the world around us. Whether that means understanding how the universe was created, how many apples you should buy at the grocery store or if you should help the old lady cross the road, it comes down to one simple rule.</p>
    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>It is not the belief that matters, but whether it makes you live a good life. It doesn't matter if someone believes that rocks hold magical powers or that cows fart rainbows, as long as they're good people we should all just be happy.</p>
