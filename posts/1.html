    <h2>Far-right in Belgium</h2>

    <p>No country is a stranger to far-right parties. Belgium is no exception! As someone who has lived there for their whole life, it's safe to say I've come to learn how our far-right party thinks and operates. I'll soon be turning 18, just falling short of eligibility for the general Belgian and Flemish elections, but I can vote for the EU parliament - and I will.</p>
    <h3>Flemish Interest</h3>
    <p>The far-right party in Flanders is called Flemish Interest (in Dutch: Vlaams Belang). Everyone here knows it by name, they have quite the status here in Flanders. Flemish Interest depicts itself as the outlier, a party that's never been voted into a government, partially because they didn't get quite enough votes and partially because no other party wanted to work together with them. In Belgium, there is an unspoken law called 'cordon sanitaire' stating no party will ever join a coalition with them. Whether that rule will be followed, will become clear after the 2024 elections...<br><br>The ideology that Flemish Interest follows is hard conservatism and separatism. This means they want to stick true to old, set-in-stone values in the Flemish history and also possibly make Flanders a sovereign nation. The latter is an extremely unlikely scenario, but it is what they're going for.</p>
    <h3>Be Flemish or get out</h3>
    <p>The tactic Flemish Interest seems to be applying in their party program and their solutions to problems - the problems they call problems - is the elimination of the cause.<br><br>During the industrial revolution, Wallonia played a major roll in the scene, they built huge factories, coal mines and power plants. This caused them to become the richer side, while Flanders was lacking behind and remaining poor. During this time, Wallonia helped Flanders economically by giving them a helping hand. Now that we've entered the 21st century, the tides have turned. Flanders is far ahead of Wallonia in terms of its economy. History is repeating itself in reverse. Flanders is now paying more to gain less, because they have to make up for the lack of investments Wallonia can provide. Even though they helped us when we were in a bad spot, Flemish Interest is now against us helping them economically. Perhaps it is because all they care about is money, perhaps it is because they believe the Walloons are lazy assholes. Who knows anymore.<br><br>A similar story emerges when you look at their program for migration. Flemish Interest wants a migration stop, meaning no more immigrants are allowed, unless they follow incredibly tough and strict guidelines. If you do get in, the party argues you should immediately start learning Dutch - the native Flemish language - and learn the Flemish norms, worths, and standards, such that you can adapt yourself to our society. While I agree that anyone immigrating to Belgium or Flanders has to make an effort to fit in, what Flemish Interest is going for is complete integration. They want to push laws prohibiting those who do not master the language or those who can't pass a Flemish-identity-exam - yes, this is a real thing - from accessing healthcare, social security and housing. In short, it's be Flemish or get the fuck out.</p>
    <h3>Eliminating "the issues"</h3>
    <p>Flemish Interest is a racist party and they don't try to hide it. Whenever a white person commits a crime, not a word is said, but whenever someone not natively Flemish or Belgian commits a crime, they start posting it on all their social channels. Statements such as 'gone with the brown rabble' and 'the more of that brown scum with their 12 maidens is killed off, the better' are just examples of things the party leader, Tom van Grieken, has said publicly. He does not shy away from these claims, they are what drive the force behind his party. Nobody can deny that he is a talented man, he is an incredible speaker and he knows how to convince an audience. I just doubt he's using it for the right cause...<br><br>The problem at hand - as they're putting it - is that these immigrants are the ones who commit the most crimes. Because of their "different" culture, they think it's okay to nearly kill a man at a train station and film it happening. Flemish Interest claims immigrants are dangerous, because they fail to adapt and because they behave like they're still in their country of origin. Thus, either sending them back or shoving the Dutch language and the Flemish way of life into their rectum must be the only way to fix this issue. All of this is completely false.<br><br>Look, I'm not here to deny that immigrants have a tendency to have a higher crime rate. It is true, the numbers and events don't lie. But cultures differ and mindsets differ. I'm not saying that what they're doing is okay in any country, but we can't control how they behave outside of Belgium. If they immigrate here, we should not see it as a threat to our national security, but as an opportunity. An opportunity to teach manners. This still doesn't mean forcing them to fill out exams, because such a thing does not convey a message. If someone is doing the wrong thing - punching people on the street, murdering in cold-blood - it should become clear without such things. The thing lacking here is not the migration being too open, it's the Belgian justice system being a complete shithole.</p>
    <h3>The justice system</h3>
    <p>It sucks.<br><br>The justice system here has been lacking for years. Not only are punishments too mild, they also cancel punishments because it is believed that 'the criminal has bettered their life' and that 'they deserve a second chance'. Don't get me wrong, I'll be the first guy to argue people deserve second chances, but there must be case exceptions to protect society from dangerous people. If we sentence a murderer to life in prison, who in their right mind would think to release them? You might think you're being nice and forgiving, but you're taking massive risks. I'm sure that some prisoners have made up their mind and will not commit a crime again, but most will and it is simply not worth it to take the risk. Our justice system does take those risks and it costs them safety. It is lacking; criminals don't get caught, sentences are too mild, sentences are cut short and dangerous criminals are freed early.<br><br>We must keep in mind that the point of a criminal sentence is not only to tell the criminal they did something wrong, but also to show society what they shouldn't do. It's a way to warn others not to do the same. But if I'm noticing the justice system sucks, anyone can notice it. So can criminals, and they abuse the system, still committing hideous crimes, because they know they'll be free again in months.<br><br>If a better and more strict justice system is introduced, crime rates will drop, no questions asked. People will finally realize that doing shit wrong actually has an impact on your life. It takes away freedom, a thing most of us care about very much. It will also show newcomers what they shouldn't do.</p>
    <h3>Better approach</h3>
    <p>I'm not here to say 'open the borders, guys, let 'em all in!', because that wouldn't be wise. People who enter a new country should still be screened, but not in weird ways like Flemish Interest is suggesting. The goal of every step and check in life should be to guarantee a person is putting in the effort. Since effort cannot be measured in a number, society has turned to methods they believe somewhat represent the amount of effort someone puts in. Things like scores at school, the amount of money in your bank account, how you look, etc. They're decent attempts at the representation of effort, but they're also severely lacking. We must remember that just because someone has a bad test score, doesn't mean they aren't putting in the effort. If someone is poor, it doesn't mean they're not trying. It is impossible to measure effort, but we can try, sadly right now we're searching it in the wrong place. And no, a totalitarian social score like proposed in China also doesn't work. Sometimes people who put in effort with no results just don't know what to do otherwise. It is up to all of us to teach each other how to get results from effort. And it is up to a government and justice system to properly guarantee everyone is putting in an effort.<br><br>Oh, and eliminating those who don't meet your standards is also the wrong approach. I'll put it like this: say you and someone else were climbing a mountain. The other person falls, because they did something wrong. Would you rather keep climbing for your own wellbeing or save them, possibly creating double as much happiness in the world?<br><br>Those who chose the first option, you know what party to vote for, and it ain't a pretty one.</p>
