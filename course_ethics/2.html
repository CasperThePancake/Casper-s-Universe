    <p>Now that I've layed a base for my ethical view, it's time to go in-depth and go over a whole bunch of other ethical problems to see how my method will fare there.</p>
    <h3>Absurd Trolley Problems</h3>
    <p>Let's start off with some advanced/absurd trolley problems, courtesy of <a target="_blank" href="https://neal.fun">neal.fun</a>. We already "solved" the default version.</p>
    <h3>5 people VS 4 people</h3>
    <img src="assets/absurdtrolley_1.png">
    <p><b>Oh no! A trolley is heading towards 5 people. You can switch the track so it kills 4 people instead. What do you do?</b><br><br>We once again assume that all of these people are equal to minimize subjectivity. If we don't push the lever, 5 people are killed and their relatives are sad - remember they have an equal amount of relatives. If we do push the lever, 4 people are killed and their relatives are sad. On the other hand, I - the one pushing the lever - am convicted for the murder of 4 innocent people.<br><br>See it this way: in both cases, 4 people are killed and their relatives are sad. The comparison we need to make then goes between a fifth dead person or me being convicted for murder. A dead person will cause much more sadness, since me being convicted doesn't immediately mean I'm dead - perhaps I wouldn't be convicted at all because I saved someone's life, it's a tough choice for the jury. Whatever the case may be, a dead man is way ethically worse than a convicted man.<br><br>I'm pushing the lever. 66% of players agree with me.</p>
    <h3>5 people VS life savings</h3>
    <img src="assets/absurdtrolley_2.png">
    <p><b>Oh no! A trolley is heading towards 5 people. You can switch the track so it crushes all your life savings instead. What do you do?</b><br><br>I don't need to waste my time here. Under any ethical circumstances, you push the lever. A human life is worth an infinite amount of money, so no amount of money you put on the other track could ever change my mind.<br><br>I'm pushing the lever. 60% of players agree with me.</p>
    <h3>5 people VS you</h3>
    <img src="assets/absurdtrolley_3.png">
    <p><b>Oh no! A trolley is heading towards 5 people. You can switch the track so it only runs you over instead. What do you do?</b><br><br>If this was a real decision, almost everyone would not push the lever. They always value their life above the lives of others. However, in my ethical view, every human life is equal, even if it is yours. When solving ethical problems such as this one, it's intelligent to lose all conscience of yourself and view the situation as a sort of God watching from above. That removes your own prejudice and the baked-in human need for survival.<br><br>I'm pushing the lever. 39% of players agree with me.</p>
    <h3>5 people VS mona lisa</h3>
    <img src="assets/absurdtrolley_4.png">
    <p><b>Oh no! A trolley is heading towards 5 people. You can switch the track so it crushes the Mona Lisa instead. What do you do?</b><br><br>I refer back to the life savings one, this is the easiest ethical problem ever. The Mona Lisa, despite its historical value, is worthless compared to 5 human lives.<br><br>I'm pushing the lever. 76% of players agree with me.</p>
    <h3>1 rich bribing person VS 1 normal person</h3>
    <img src="assets/absurdtrolley_5.png">
    <p><b>Oh no! A trolley is heading towards a rich person. They're offering you $500.000 to switch the track and kill a normal man. What do you do?</b><br><br>We can all agree that the rich guy is a prick. He is basically offering $500.000 for a human life. As I mentioned, human lives are worth infinity dollars, so this would never cover the cost.<br><br>Even if we completely ignore his offer, a 1 person VS 1 person scenario is still easy to solve. In both cases one person dies, but if I push the lever I also face negative consequences. It is thus much more ethically correct to leave the lever alone and kill the rich fucker.<br><br>I'm not pushing the lever. 49% of players agree with me.</p>
    <h3>5 lobsters VS 1 cat</h3>
    <img src="assets/absurdtrolley_6.png">
    <p><b>Oh no! A trolley is heading towards 5 lobsters. You can switch the track so it kills 1 cat instead. What do you do?</b><br><br>This is definitely a tough one, since it's about animals this time.<br><br>If we do nothing, 5 lobsters are killed and not a lot of people will care. Nobody is emotionally attached to a lobster. It is true that there are much less lobsters on Earth than cats (250 million lobsters as opposed to 800 million cats), but that doesn't affect this decision. If we do push the lever, one cat is killed. People have a bigger emotional attachment to a cat, so running it over would cause much more human distress. On top of that, I'm the one who just murdered a cat, so I would also get in trouble. Thus, if you weigh it all in - the suffering of the animals, the emotional attachment, the distress for the public, and the consequences for me - it's a clear choice.<br><br>I'm not pushing the lever. 85% of players agree with me.</p>
    <h3>5 sleeping people VS 1 awake person</h3>
    <img src="assets/absurdtrolley_7.png">
    <p><b>Oh no! A trolley is heading towards 5 people who are sleeping and won't feel pain. You can switch the track so it kills one person who is wide-awake instead. What do you do?</b><br><br>This is the basic trolley problem we all know with a sleepy twist. That means all we have to do is see if them sleeping changes our decision. The prompt says they won't feel pain, but given the realism of the situation that is very unlikely. Additionally, whether they're sleeping or not, their relatives will still mourn their death. Killing 5 people who are sleeping brings only a pinch less distress than killing 5 people who are awake.<br><br>I'm pushing the lever. 51% of players agree with me.</p>
    <h3>5 suicidal people VS 1 accident</h3>
    <img src="assets/absurdtrolley_8.png">
    <p><b>Oh no! A trolley is heading towards 5 people who tied themselves to the track. You can switch the track so it kills one person who tripped onto the tracks instead. What do you do?</b><br><br>Once again, this is the trolley problem we all know with a simple twist. The 5 people on the main track voluntarily got onto it. This raises a few questions we should consider.<br>Do these people know that they'll feel immense pain and suffering? Tying yourself to the track does not necessarily mean you won't feel pain.<br>Will the relatives of these 5 people be more alright with their deaths because it was their own decision? Even if someone decides to kill themselves voluntarily - in other words, suicide -, this does not mean their relatives won't care. They might accept it more quickly, but the distress, pain, and suffering caused remains relatively the same.<br><br>I'm pushing the lever. 21% of players agree with me.</p>
    <h3>Speed up the trolley</h3>
    <img src="assets/absurdtrolley_9.png">
    <p><b>Oh no! A trolley is heading towards 5 people. You can push the lever, but it just speeds up the trolley, which might make it less painful. What do you do?</b><br><br>If we don't push the lever, 5 people are killed with immense suffering. If we do push the lever, 5 people are killed by a faster trolley, which <i>might</i> make it less painful. It also means I get involved and have technically murdered 5 people. This one is obvious.<br><br>I'm not pushing the lever. 29% of players agree with me.</p>
    <h3>Amazon package</h3>
    <img src="assets/absurdtrolley_10.png">
    <p><b>Oh no! A trolley is heading towards 1 person. You can push the lever to divert it to an empty track, but then your Amazon package will be late. What do you do?</b><br><br>The disagreement probably comes from funny trolls on the internet.<br><br>I'm pushing the lever. 80% of players agree with me.</p>
    <h3>Your best friend VS 5 people</h3>
    <img src="assets/absurdtrolley_11.png">
    <p><b>Oh no! A trolley is heading towards your best friend. You can push the lever to make it run over 5 strangers instead. What do you do?</b><br><br>We need to view this dilemma from a third-party, like a God from above who is not aware of or neglects the relations between those involved. In that case, it is an inverse of the normal trolley problem, which makes things even easier. Yes, not pushing the lever brings me suffering - because my best friend just died -, but those 5 strangers also each have friends who will suffer more in total.<br><br>I'm not pushing the lever. 28% of players agree with me.</p>
    <h3>Uncertain</h3>
    <img src="assets/absurdtrolley_12.png">
    <p><b>Oh no! A trolley is heading towards 5 people. You can push the lever to kill 1 person instead. At least, that's what you think. You left your glasses at home. What do you do?</b><br><br>If we're not sure what our decision will cause, it's best to not get involved and do nothing.<br><br>I'm not pushing the lever. 47% of players agree with me.</p>
    <h3>Cousins</h3>
    <img src="assets/absurdtrolley_13.png">
    <p><b>Oh no! A trolley is heading towards your first cousin. You can push the lever to make it run over 3 of your second cousins instead. What do you do?</b><br><br>As a non-native English speaker, I'm uncertain what a cousin is, but it doesn't matter in my ethical view anyways. If I don't do anything, only one person is killed and I don't face consequences.<br><br>I'm not pushing the lever. 58% of people agree with me.</p>
    <h3>5 elders VS 1 baby</h3>
    <img src="assets/absurdtrolley_14.png">
    <p><b>Oh no! A trolley is heading towards 5 elderly people. You can push the lever to make it run over 1 baby instead. What do you do?</b><br><br>This is the hardest problem by far. Even a God viewing from above is aware of the age difference, so it must be taken into account - if we just saw them as equal people this would be a horrific decision.<br><br>We must focus on the long-term consequences for all of mankind. The elderly people have already had their life and they have already contributed to society. Killing them would cause much less distress than the death of a new-born baby. On the other hand, the baby has a whole future ahead of it. It might invent the cure for cancer, it will make thousands of people happy in its life, unless it dies at a young age. This problem is fundamentally flawed because we cannot predict the future. If we go off of the average human's life, though, the baby will bring much more happiness in its life than the elderly can ever do combined in the rest of their life.<br><br>I'm not pushing the lever. 76% of players agree with me.</p>
    <h3>Attack of the clones</h3>
    <img src="assets/absurdtrolley_15.png">
    <p><b>Oh no! A trolley is heading towards 5 of your clones. You can push the lever to make it run you over instead. What do you do?</b><br><br>This is a tough one as well. Even if I wasn't aware of the creation of these clones, I don't think any of my relatives need 6 different versions of me walking around. Killing 5 of my clones still means they have the original me left, so this would not result in distress. On the other hand, killing myself and leaving my relatives with 5 clones would cause tons of distress.<br><br>I'm not pushing the lever. 88% of players agree with me.</p>
    <h3>Different chances</h3>
    <img src="assets/absurdtrolley_16.png">
    <p><b>Oh no! A trolley is heading towards a box with a 50% chance of containing 2 people. You can switch the track to make it hit a box with a 10% chance of containing 10 people. What do you do?</b><br><br>Since we once again do not know what will happen with complete certainty, the safest option is the best option. If we don't push the lever, there is an equal chance that 0 or 2 people are killed. If we do push the lever, there is a 9/10 chance that nobody dies, but a 1/10 chance that 10 people die.<br><br>I'm not pushing the lever. 43% of players agree with me.</p>
    <h3>Robots</h3>
    <img src="assets/absurdtrolley_17.png">
    <p><b>Oh no! A trolley is heading towards 5 sentient robots. You can push the lever to make it run over one person instead. What do you do?</b><br><br>A human life is worth an infinite amount of money. It doesn't matter how expensive these robots are. The only reason why I would push the lever is if this robot will do such great things that it will bring even more happiness than saving a life can. This, however, is uncertain.<br><br>I'm not pushing the lever. 84% of players agree with me.</p>
    <h3>Economic damage</h3>
    <img src="assets/absurdtrolley_18.png">
    <p><b>Oh no! A trolley is heading towards 3 empty trolleys worth $900.000. You can push the lever to make it hit one empty trolley worth $300.000 instead. What do you do?</b><br><br>I don't see why this should be complicated. Pushing the lever saves $600.000 from going to waste.<br><br>I'm pushing the lever. 78% of players agree with me.</p>
    <h3>CO<sub>2</sub></h3>
    <img src="assets/absurdtrolley_19.png">
    <p><b>Oh no! A trolley is releasing 100kg of C02 per year which will kill 5 people over 30 years. You can push the lever to destroy it with a brick wall. What do you do?</b><br><br>If we simplify the problem, we get two choices: letting 5 people die in 30 years and destroying the climate, or destroying a trolley. I think you see where this is going.<br><br>I'm pushing the lever.60% of players agree with me.</p>
    <h3>Reincarnation</h3>
    <img src="assets/absurdtrolley_20.png">
    <p><b>Oh no! You will eventually be reincarnated as every single person in this classic trolley problem. What do you do?</b><br><br>It's just the classic trolley problem, but we will be reincarnated as every person in it at some point. As we went over before, this does not matter to our final decision, thus rendering this equal to a normal trolley problem.<br><br>I'm pushing the lever. 52% of players agree with me.</p>
    <h3>Trolled</h3>
    <img src="assets/absurdtrolley_21.png">
    <p><b>Oh no! A trolley is heading towards nothing, but you kinda want to prank the trolley driver. What do you do?</b><br><br>As funny as this prompt is, not doing anything is the better decision, since you may never know what could happen to the trolley on the other track. If it ends up killing someone there, you'll be held accountable for your epic trolling.<br><br>I'm not pushing the lever. 37% of players agree with me.</p>
    <h3>Citizens</h3>
    <img src="assets/absurdtrolley_22.png">
    <p><b>Oh no! A trolley is heading towards a good citizen. You can push the lever to make it run over a bad citizen who litters instead. What do you do?</b><br><br>We really have to go over both options for this one. If we don't push the lever, a good citizen is murdered. If we do push the lever, a bad citizen is murdered and we are held accountable. In this scenario, the question we must ask ourselves is whether our conviction is worse than the difference between a good and a bad citizen. A citizen will die eitherway, but are the good deeds of the good citizen more important/significant than me being convicted? It's an incredibly subjective matter. I'm biased, since I find littering a horrendous crime.<br><br>I'm pushing the lever. 80% of players agree with me.</p>
    <h3>Eternity</h3>
    <p><b>Oh no! A trolley is stuck in an infinite loop with no escape for the passengers. If you push the lever, the trolley will explode. What do you do?</b><br><br>Whether we push this lever or not, all the passengers will die eventually. The eventual result is the same in that sense. The only differences are the way in which they die and the time it will take until that happens. Exploding these passengers may seem more painful than starving them, but I am convinced that ending it instantly for them in this way will result in less suffering than leaving them there for weeks while they start eating eachother.<br><br>I'm pushing the lever. 58% of players agree with me.</p>
    <h3>Enemy</h3>
    <img src="assets/absurdtrolley_24.png">
    <p><b>Oh yes! A trolley is heading towards your worst enemy and nobody will ever know you were there. You can push the lever to divert it to an empty track. What do you do?</b><br><br>Even if nobody will ever know you were there, just seeing someone being run over by a trolley - even if they are your worst enemy - will scar you for life. You should always give people a second - or third, or twentieth - chance, so sparing your enemy is the most ethical option.<br><br>I'm pushing the lever. 50% of players agree with me.</p>
    <h3>Lifespan</h3>
    <img src="assets/absurdtrolley_25.png">
    <p><b>Oh no! A trolley is heading towards 1 person, which will lower their lifespan by 50 years. You can push the lever to make it hit 5 people, lowering each of their lifespans by 10 years instead. What do you do?</b><br><br>This one is surprisingly deep.My main argument is that whatever happens to these people, nobody will ever be able to point out that it happened because of a trolley. 1 person having 50 less years will cause less suffering than 10 less years for 5 people, since that is even less noticeable.<br><br>I'm pushing the lever. 64% of players agree with me.</p>
    <h3>Time travel</h3>
    <p><b>Oh no! A trolley is heading towards 5 people, but you can push the lever to make it run over 5 people 100 years from now. What do you do?</b><br><br>This final problem is very well thought-out. Whatever we choose to do, 5 people will be killed. The only difference is that I won't see them being killed if I send the trolley through the portal. However, I hear you ask, won't you be held accountable for the murder of 5 people? Well, unless I become the oldest person ever, I'll be dead by the time they get run over.<br><br>I'm pushing the lever. 70% of players agree with me.</p>
