    <h2>Welcome to Casper's Universe</h2>
    <p>Hello! My name is Casper. You've stumbled upon my hand-made website, where I discuss and "teach" a wide range of subjects. You can find all sorts of things here: stuff about me and my projects, but also a bunch of courses on physics, maths, biology, chemistry, geography, and much more. I plan to turn everything I learned in school (starting at the age of 16) into a course for you to read. I'm good at explaining things in a simple, yet efficient matter - if I do say so myself.</p>
    <h2>Disclaimer</h2>
    <p>Courses on this website are not free of mistakes. I research some topics myself, and even courses crafted from my school curriculum could contain slight mistakes. This website is meant as a tool for anyone to learn anything I've learnt in a simple and free way, as well as a way to share my vision of the world. This means that mistakes can slip in and also that some of my courses are slightly subjective.</p>
    <h2>Getting started</h2>
    <p>There are many things to do here. To get started, click on any of the links in the top navigation bar. From there, you can choose more specific options and courses to look into.</p>
    <h2>Research</h2>
    <p>How exactly did I research these topics? Let's split it up into 3 parts.<br><br><b>1. Self-learning</b><br>I mostly used Wikipedia as a base for this, but I found that the explanations there for certain physical concepts are way too far-fetched. Sometimes you want to research a simple subject and they start throwing fucking quantum mechanics at your face, please calm down. In general, it's hard to find one good website that covers all parts of a subject with good explanations and derivations for every formula or theory. I guess that's kinda the goal with creating this little website, a hub for anyone to discover just how simple certain subjects can be. I try to make my explanations as low-level as possible, so everyone can follow what I'm saying. You will also notice that ChatGPT is denoted as a source on almost every course. This is true, I use it a lot for explanations and derivations, but I always fact-check what it says with another source.<br><br><b>2. School curriculum</b><br>If I learn about a subject in school and write a course about it here, I try to turn what I learned into a more efficient and easily digestable package. This means that some details may be dropped, but the general trustworthiness of the information I provide in these courses is much higher than self-researched topics. If there are grave mistakes here, you can blame my teachers.<br><br><b>3. Subjective topics</b><br>The rarest type of content you'll find in courses here is subjective content, such as ethics. Most of the time these courses are loosely based on self-research (see point 1), but a big part of it is my own opinion. Take everything you read there with a grain of salt, and think about your own opinions while you're at it.</p>
