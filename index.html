    <h1>Physicae</h1>
    <h5>by Casper</h5>
    <h2>Welcome to Physicae</h2>
    <p>My name is Casper, I like making websites to practise my web designing skills. Combining that hobby with my love for physics seemed like a perfect match, which is why I created Physicae. It is a (personal) journey through the land of physics. We'll be exploring the foundation laid by Newton, the discoveries made by many physicists, up until the modern-day revolutions by Einstein and Hawking.</p>
    <h2>Disclaimer</h2>
    <p>I am not a physicist (yet), I am a 16-year-old student, so what I say here could definitely be wrong. I am here to learn, so any faults you find can be reported to me. The way this works is simple; I research a subject using the internet, I summarise that theory here. There will be subjects I myself am not too good at understanding, but we'll get through it.</p>
    <h2>Getting started</h2>
    <p>I'll be choosing subjects throughout physics in a non-chronological order. This way I get to explore all aspects of this beautiful science. I recommend you start where I started by selecting the <a href="course/1.html">first course</a>, because everything after builds on prior knowledge.</p>
    <h2>Research</h2>
    <p>How exactly did I research these topics? I mostly used Wikipedia as a base, but I found that the explanations there for certain physical concepts are way too far-fetched. Sometimes you want to research a simple subject and they start throwing fucking quantum mechanics at your face, please calm down. In general, it's hard to find one good website that covers all parts of physics with good explanations and derivations for every formula or theory. I guess that's kinda the goal with creating this little website, a hub for anyone to discover just how simple physics can be. I try to make my explanations as low-level as possible, so everyone can follow what I'm saying.</p>
