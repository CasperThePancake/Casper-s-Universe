    <h1>Physicae</h1>
    <h5>by Casper</h5>
    <h2>Welcome to Physicae</h2>
    <p>My name is Casper, I like making websites to practise my web designing skills. Combining that hobby with my love for physics seemed like a perfect match, which is why I created Physicae. It is a (personal) journey through the land of physics. We'll be exploring the foundation laid by Newton, the discoveries made by many physicists, up until the modern-day revolutions by Einstein and Hawking.</p>
    <h2>Disclaimer</h2>
    <p>I am not a physicist (yet), I am a 16-year-old student, so what I say here could definitely be wrong. I am here to learn, so any faults you find can be reported to me. The way this works is simple; I research a subject using the internet, I summarise that theory here. There will be subjects I myself am not too good at understanding, but we'll get through it.</p>
    <h2>Getting started</h2>
    <p>I'll be choosing subjects throughout physics in a non-chronological order. This way I get to explore all aspects of this beautiful science.</p>
