    <h2>The Law of Universal Gravity</h2>
    <h3 id="wordCount">COUNT</h3>
    <p>Let's get started with Newton's laws of motion. There are 3 laws of motion with different formulas and definitions attached to them.</p>
    <h3>The basics</h3>
    <p>Newton states that every object (that has a mass) is constantly applying a force on every other object in the universe. This sounds insane, but we don't really notice this because this force is proportional to the mass of each object, and inversely proportional to their distance. The bread in your closet is applying force on you, and you are also applying force on it, but this is so small that you will never notice it. What you can notice is that Earth is attracting you at all times, that's gravity.</p>
    <h3>The formula</h3>
    <p>We know (through experiments) that this new gravitational force is proportional to the product of the two objects' masses, and inversely proportional to the distance squared. To get a formula out of this we have to add a constant at the front. This will be G, the gravitational constant.$$F=G\frac{m_{1}m_{2}}{r^{2}}$$As you can tell from this formula, both objects will experience an equal force between them. This means that when the Earth applies force on us, we are also applying an equal force on Earth, sounds like Newton's third law of motion, right? But Earth is not moving because of us - it's moving because of its orbit around the sun. This is because the huge mass of Earth means that same force has a much smaller effect in acceleration. This is just like our example with the gun recoil and the bullet.</p>

    <h3>Gravity on Earth</h3>
    <p>In school you probably learned a different formula to calculate the gravitational force on Earth:$$F=gm$$But how do we get to this formula from Newton's foundation?<br><br>Let's say that m1 is Earth's mass and m2 is the mass of the object on Earth (i.e. a human). All the values besides m2 are constants, since we have G (gravitational constant), m1 (mass of Earth) and r (radius of Earth). If we calculate all these values like in Newton's formula we get the following result.$$g=\frac{m_{earth}·G}{r_{earth}^{2}}$$ $$g=\frac{5.972 · 10^{24} kg·6.674 · 10^{-11} \frac{m^{3}}{kg·s^{2}}}{(6,371,000m)^{2}}$$ $$g=9.81 \frac{m}{s^{2}}$$This means that, on Earth, an object's velocity will increase by 9.81 m/s every single second - m/s² (acceleration) is the derivative of velocity, and velocity is the derivative of position.</p>

        <tr>
          <td>Gravity acceleration (g)</td>
          <td>Meters per second squared</td>
          <td>m/s²</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    <p>Since our formula is F=gm, this also means the unit of our constant g is N/kg. This lets you calculate the change in motion (force) for any object on Earth, if you know the mass.<br><br>As a sidenote I also want to mention that mass and weigh are not the same thing. Mass is the amount of mass an object has, a property of that object. Weight is the force the object feels due to gravity, as calculated with F=mg.<br><br>Some of you might may be confused. Why does every object, regardless of its mass, accelerate 9.81 m/s every second? While acceleration due to Earth's gravitational force is equal for all objects, eventhough their masses differ, the force your object experiences will be greater for heavier objects, as per Newton's second law of motion (F=ma). This does <u>not</u> mean that that heavier force does cause your heavier object to fall faster. In a complete vacuum, without any other external forces, every object, heavy or light, will fall at the same rate. Even if they are experiencing a larger force, the large mass will balance out the F=ma formula and once again prove that the acceleration (a) will be equal. This might be hard to wrap your head around, because human intuition would say a brick falls faster than a feather, but this is only caused by the existence of air and air resistance.<br><br>Switching around the values in F=ma also teaches us that a=F/m, thus meaning that N/m is the same as m/s in this context, explaining why 9.81 m/s is also known as that 9.81 N/kg.<br><br>Congratulations, you now have a great understanding of Newton's law of universal gravitation!</p>
