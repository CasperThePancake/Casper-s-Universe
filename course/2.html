    <h2>The Three Equations of Motion</h2>
    <p>We already learned about Newton's 3 Laws of Motion, but there are 3 more equations that each build on the previous one, which we'll learn now.</p>
    <h3>Definitions</h3>
    <p>We'll be using acceleration a lot here. Acceleration is the derivative of velocity, meaning it is a change in velocity. We'll also be using the symbol 'u', which stands for the initial velocity of our object. This is the velocity the object had before the acceleration (or the force) was applied. In most cases, this will be 0, if the object accelerates from a position of rest.</p>
    <h3>The first equation</h3>
    <p>The first equation is quite simple, here it is:$$v=u+at$$Where v is the velocity at the time t, and a is acceleration. Remember that we're still playing with physics in a forceless arena with no external forces, the acceleration does not decrease! Understanding this formula should be fairly easy. To calculate our current velocity, we take the initial velocity, and calculate how much we have gained (or lost, if acceleration is negative) by multiplying acceleration by time.</p>
    <h3>The second equation</h3>
    <p>Before I derive this awesome new formula, I'll just throw it at you.$$s=ut+\frac{1}{2}at^{2}$$You should know every symbol here, except s. This symbol, standing for 'displacement', will return in the next course, but it basically stands for the distance that an object has traveled. Because of this, we get the logical conclusion:$$v=\frac{s}{t}$$ $$s=v⋅t$$This is fine, but since we have acceleration, our velocity is <u>not constant</u>, so we'll need to take the average - this is a rule in kinematics. That means the following:$$s=\frac{u+v}{2}⋅t$$From the first equation in this course, we know that v=u+at, so let's replace v by that in our current formula and get this:$$s=\frac{u+(u+at)}{2}⋅t$$We simplify...$$s=\frac{2u+at}{2}⋅t$$ $$s=ut+\frac{1}{2}at^{2}$$And proven it has been! This new equation shows the relation between initial velocity, acceleration, time, and displacement.</p>
    <h3>The third equation</h3>
    <p>I'm once again spitting this formula in your face first.$$v^{2}-u^{2}=2as$$Let's go back to the formula for displacement with average velocity:$$s=\frac{u+v}{2}⋅t$$Now we can once again go to the first equation we have and convert it to this:$$v=u+at$$ $$t=\frac{v-u}{a}$$Then we replace t in our previous formula with this calculation:$$s=\frac{u+v}{2}⋅t$$ $$s=(\frac{u+v}{2})⋅(\frac{v-u}{a})$$After that we just simplify!$$s=\frac{v^{2}-u^{2}}{2a}$$ $$v^{2}-u^{2}=2as$$Another awesome equation derived! This one shows the relation between initial velocity, velocity, acceleration and displacement. The difference with the previous one (second equation) is that this one does not contain t, while the previous one did not contain v. Two different relations, two different equations!</p>
